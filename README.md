# DIVS
A rigorously engineered tabulator for the Danish list-based voting scheme.

This project was originally developed by Ólavur Kjølbro in order to verify the 
Danish Electoral Law as a main part of his master's thesis over a period of six 
months from November 2010 - April 2011. The work was done under keen supervison 
from Ph.D. student Dermot Cochran and Dr. Joseph Kiniry at the IT University of 
Copenhagen.
